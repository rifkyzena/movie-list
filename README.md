# Movie List

Movie List is a simple web application that provides information about popular movies all over the world. This website enables the user to add the movie to their watchlist. There are three types of user’s role in this website: Guest (non-logged-in user), User, and Admin. Movies can be sorted and arranged to different categories and this website also provides short biography of the actors starring in each movies. Admins can add a movie or an actor to the database while users are able to put a movie into their watchlist. Admins are also able to edit existing movies in the database; updating them or deleting them. This web application was made by HTML, CSS, and JS with PHP logic and Laravel 8 Framework that uses MySQL to connect to the database.

Movie List was built with Model View Controller (MVC) architecture.
